			<h2>Just who am I anyhow?</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>My name is <span class='pastel_red'>Cory Sabol</span>. I'm a computer programmer,
				who dabbles in web security and game design.</p>
			<p>My main focus however is web development and design. I love that I can take code and create something useful and beautiful.</p>
		</div>

		<div id='languages'>
			<h2>What I know.</h2>
			<hr>
			<div>
				<h3>JavaScript</h3>
				<p>I suppose you could say that JavaScript is my favorite language. Despite all of it's flaws it's a very flexible and robust language.
					You can't avoid it either, it's everywhere on the web and now it's even on the server side!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Java</h3>
				<p>Java is a language I have become very familiar with through school projects. I can't claim to have used it for much of anything
					outside of academic work. But if you really need to have names proceedurally generated using markov chains then I've go you covered
					with <a href=''>N-Gen</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Lua</h3>
				<p>Lua is another one of the "fun" languages. I really enjoy using it for it's extreme flexibility and rapid prototyping.
					As with Java I haven't used the language for much other than my own hobby game projects. You can check out <a href=''>SGEngine</a>
					and the original game jam version of Super <a href=''>Chair Balance Sim 2014</a>(that I coded in 6 hours).
